Stock market news live updates: Stocks rise, recovering some losses as oil prices sink

Stocks rose Wednesday to recover some losses after a volatile start to the week, as concerns over the impact of the punitive measures countries and companies have taken against Russia weighed on U.S. equity markets.

The S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq each jumped. The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, dropped nearly 10% but still held above the 30 level. A day earlier, the S&P 500 dropped another 0.7% on Tuesday to bring its year-to-date losses to 12.5%. The Dow shed more than 0.5% to sink further into a correction, while the Nasdaq Composite extended losses after sliding into a bear market earlier this week.
